## Vision
Provide excellent solutions to business problems with the best possible combination of tools and minds, with no compromises.

## Mission 
Our mission is to provide only the best possible solutions at the best possible cost to customers of any scale. We will closely observe and listen to customer pain points, encounter root causes and provide solutions based on the best possible combination of tools and process, even if we need to learn new technology. We will not take on projects that do not align with strategic success for ourselves and our customers, and we aim for each project to be a case study of innovation.

## Objectives
* Provide deep, rich, full stack solutions to customers aligned 100% with strategic vision.
* Create a sustainable business model based on very small teams and a lean organization low on overhead and structure but rich in efficient and transparent processes.
* Establish a totally virtual working environment and structure that allows people to work at their best potential, when and wherever they are.
* Become the solution that our customers strongly recommend to other customers.
* Achieve 100% commitment by attracting talent strongly aligned with our vision, and promote a culture of constant learning.

## Competitive advantage
* Only ninjas for our teams, and those willing to become ninjas. Our collective experience and network will become the base that will grow as our ninjas recruit from their networks. We want the discouraged, the difficult and the lazy who refuse to waste their time. We want Ronin. We want people unafraid to innovate themselves out of a job.
* We will not turn down projects that our larger competitors do not consider because they are too small or do not present staffing opportunities. We will actively pursue these opportunities.
* We will not sell a specific technology set or stack based on current internal skills and capacity but rather find the best possible solution and learn it.
* We will use a pricing model based on sizing for value that aligns with Agile estimation and assign cost to features.
* We will structure contracts based on business value of projects and strict Agile delivery; where possible we will include customer KPIs for percentage of returning revenue. This will remove the time-consuming process of time and material or fixed cost project contract negotiation based entirely on ROI and value aligned to the core business strategy and vision.
* We will seek open-source solutions where possible to best share innovation beyond individual projects. This will serve to promote our vision as well as our customers, and establish ourselves as thought leaders.
